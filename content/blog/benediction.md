I launched my first app on the app store! [Benediction](/benediction) has been a pet project I've been working on in my limited free time. It's written completely in SwiftUI, and I'm super proud of it. Each day, people will see the same prayer sourced from scripture or historical church leaders throughout various Christian traditions. Feel free to check it out and let me know what you think.

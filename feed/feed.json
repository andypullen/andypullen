It's written completely in SwiftUI, and I'm super proud of it. Each day, people will see the same prayer sourced from scripture or historical church leaders throughout various Christian traditions. Feel free to check it out and let me know what you think.</p>\n",

Are there jibbitz for other things? What does jibbitz mean? Do people still wear crocs? Do people who still wear crocs actually decorate them with jibbitz? What about toe jibbitz? These are important questions!</p>\n<p>This kid is a genius.</p>\n<p><em>Update:</em> These toe jibbitz might not be available any more. Too bad.</p>\n",
